Physics1 is a repository for programs related to my physics course at university.
It's a fork of professor Sinigardi's repository.

The objective of those programs are an introduction to **numerical integration** and an applied example with **uniform circular motion**.

#### How to build the programs
1. Enter directory with `cd "name of the project"`
2. Create makefile from cmake with `cmake .`
3. Complie with `make`
4. Run the program with `./"name of the program"`

For oscillator project you can create the plot with `gnuplot plot.pl` command if you have [gnuplot](http://www.gnuplot.info/) installed.
